# AzurePolicy
**Azure Policies**

Over time I will add Azure Policies as I create them. First up is a policy that only allows HSM-based Key Vaults.

Azure Policies are a way to enforce or detect specific settings in Azure. I wrote about them here https://michaelhowardsecure.blog/2019/03/29/azure-policy-a-love-story/

**IMPORTANT** Remember that policy can take 30mins from deployment to be effective.
